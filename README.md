## Theme

Help farmers in getting insight about the future prices about commodities.

My work is about to maximize profit and reduce the loss of farmer by predicting the price of agricultural commodities of different Mandi.

## AIM

We aim to provide a better price analytics which farmers can leverage to build better profitability models and carefully manage their
risks while taking the decisions while growing the crop.

## Our Solution 

We aim to build a predictive model of the future supply and demand of commodity prices which provides insight into the price of the commodity
by using previous year data, weather data, and future investments and development in farming which affects the supply demand situation.

## Working

We would a create an online platform such as a website or an app which continuously takes input data from all of our sources, transmits it 
to our API endpoints on the Azure cloud where we would have kept our trained models to return supply-demand predictions which would be 
displayed on the platform.
